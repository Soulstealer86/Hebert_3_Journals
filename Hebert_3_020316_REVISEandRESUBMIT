We will be revising our games so that they are more 'finished'. This will require revision and retweaking.
Ok

Why bother with revising and resubmitting?
Well, we would revise this like an essay, it can always be better (unless it can't) 
so we should always strive to make it so, and we should resubmit it because we can't just expect you to find it in our home files
