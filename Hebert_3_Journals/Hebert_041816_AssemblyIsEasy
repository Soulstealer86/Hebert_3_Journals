For what computational reason did you type elf64?
It's the 64-bit operating system

Why did you use ld?
I really don't know.... I just learned a tiny bit of this, but not that.

Why did you not have to use chmod to make sample executable?
What's chmod?

It still doesn't work.

Given your actual experience with Assembly now --- Is assembly 'quick and easy'? Why or why not?
NO. Didn't think it was easy even in the game...
