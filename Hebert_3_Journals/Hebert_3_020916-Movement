How can / will you make the orb move in the direction you are facing?
Add a code that makes it move?

Explain and provide specific code.


var projectile : Transform;
 var bulletSpeed : float = 20;
 
 function Update () {
     // Put this in your update function
     if (Input.GetButtonDown("LeftMouse")) {
 
     // Instantiate the projectile at the position and rotation of this transform
     var clone : Transform;
     clone = Instantiate(projectile, transform.position, transform.rotation);
 
     // Add force to the cloned object in the object's forward direction
     clone.rigidbody.AddForce(clone.transform.forward * shootForce);
     }
 }
