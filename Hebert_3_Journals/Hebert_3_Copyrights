*Copyright- the exclusive right to make copies

*Copyleft- To copyleft a program, we first state that it is copyrighted; then we add distribution terms,
 which are a legal instrument that gives everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the program's code,
 or any program derived from it, but only if the distribution terms are unchanged.
 Thus, the code and the freedoms become legally inseparable.

*Fair Use- Fair use is a limitation and exception to the exclusive right granted by copyright law to the author of a creative work.

*Free Software-  computer software that gives users the freedom to run the software for any purpose as well as to study,
change, and distribute the software and the adapted versions.

*Freeware- is computer software that is available for use at no monetary cost, which may have restrictions such as redistribution prohibited,
 and for which source code is not available. Freeware, although itself free of charge, may be intended to benefit its owner, e.g. by encouraging sales of a more capable version.
 According to the Free Software Foundation (FSF), "freeware" is a loosely defined category and it has no clear accepted definition,
 although FSF asks that free software (libre; unrestricted and with source code available) should not be called freeware.

*Public Domain-Works in the public domain are those whose intellectual property rights have expired,[1] have been forfeited,[2] or are inapplicable.

*File-Sharing-the practice of sharing computer data or space on a network 

*Piracy-the unauthorized reproduction or use of a copyrighted product

*Plagiarism-an act or instance of using or closely imitating the language and thoughts of another author
 without authorization and the representation of that author's work as one's
 own, as by not crediting the original author

*Infringment-a breach or infraction, as of a law, right, or obligation; violation; transgression. 

*Proprietary-manufactured and sold only by the owner of the patent, formula, brand name, or trademark associated with the product

*Open Source-pertaining to or denoting software whose source code is available free of charge to the public to use, copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute. 

*GNU GPL-

*License-the legal right to use a patent owned by another. 

*MIT license-The MIT License is a very liberal software license that was originally developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

*Apache License-The agreement stipulates terms for use, reproduction, modification and distribution of any software that is released under the Apache License.

*EULA-EULA is a legal contract between the manufacturer and/or the author and the end user of an application.
 The EULA details how the software can and cannot be used and any
 restrictions that the manufacturer imposes

*Creative Commons- non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon legally and to share.
