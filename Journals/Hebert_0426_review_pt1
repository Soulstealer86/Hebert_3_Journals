Write a Java method to return a cubed value of some number:
public static int cube (int 3){
    return (3*3*3);
}

Write an arduino function to return the cubed value of some number:
float y(float x)
   {
   return 8.0 * pow(x, 1.0/3.0) - 1.3;
   }

Create the class, an object, and a class constructor for class student:
public class student {
String student;
int grade;
boolean hashair;
String hairtype;
String eyecolour;
String clothingstyle;
}
Describe - if we were to continue with Arduino - what would you create?
I don't think I'd be able to create something functioning, 
but maybe I could do a light and speaker thing, 
or that infuriating frequency device
