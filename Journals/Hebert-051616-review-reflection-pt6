Explain casting, Up-Casting, Down-Casting:
*Casting is basically taking an object and "turning it into another".
Sort of like taking iron and /casting/ it into a sword.

*Up casting is pretty much taking someone's B grade and making it an A

*Down casting is like taking someone's A grade and making it an B,
BUT you need more information to do this than to Up-Cast.

Give a specific code example for Up-Casting:
Cat c1 = new Cat();		 
	Animal a = c1;		 //automatic upcasting to Animal

Give a specific code example for Down-Casting:
Car c1 = new Car();		 
	Vehicle a = c1;		 
	Car c2 = (Car) a;    //manual downcasting back to a Car

Give a specific code example for converting a char to a string:
char ch = 'U';
String charToString = Character.toString(ch);

What is the range of values for byte? Why?
127, because in binary it's 0111111, and -128. 
The -128 is strange because you'd think that 
128 would be 10000000 would be a POSITIVE 128, but NO.
It's negative. There's a system that explains the reason for this called Two's Complement.
