The Devil Within

I will keep quiet
You won't even know I'm here
You won't suspect a thing
You won't see me in the mirror
But I crept into your heart
You can't make me disappear
Til I make you
I made myself at home
In the cobwebs and the lies
I'm learning all your tricks
I can hurt you from inside
Oh I made myself a promise
You would never see me cry
Til I make you
You'll never know what hit you
Won't see me closing in
I'm gonna make you suffer
This Hell you put me in
I'm underneath your skin
You'll never know what hit you
I will be here
When you think you're all alone
Seeping through the cracks
I'm the poison in your bones
My love is your disease
I won't let it set you free
Til I break you
I tried to be the lover to your nightmare
Look what you made of me
Now I'm the heavy burden that you can't bear
Look what you made of me
Look what you made of me
I'll make you see
You'll never know what hit you
Won't see me closing in
I'm gonna make you suffer
This Hell you put me in
I'm underneath your skin
You'll never know what hit you

Where the Lonely Ones Roam

Won't you come out we can paint the town red.
Kill a little time you can sleep when you are dead.
Cause it isn't over yet,
get it outta your head.
Chase a couple hearts we could leave em in shreds. 
Meet me in the gutter make the devil your friend.
Just remember what I said, cause it isn't over yet.
Just remember what I said, cause it isn't over yet.

CHORUS 
Say you have a little faith in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home.
Need to have a little trust in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home, to where the lonely ones roam.

Won't you come out I've been waiting for you,
holding my breath til my body turned blue.
We got everything to lose, yeah I'm waiting on you.
Suns come up and there's no one else around, 
meet me in the shadows while you tell me what you 
found.
You got everything to lose, yeah I'm waiting on you.

CHORUS
Say you have a little faith in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home.
Need to have a little trust in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home, to where the lonely ones roam.
To where the lonely ones roam.

Roam with me, come down to where all the others fell,
Get lost in the dark to find yourself.
Just remember what I said, 
no it isn't over yet.

CHORUS
Say you have a little faith in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home.
Need to have a little trust in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home, to where the lonely ones roam.
To where the lonely ones roam.

Need to have a little trust in me,
just close your eyes and let me lead,
follow me home, to where the lonely ones roam.

IB Bad Apple

Ever on and on I continue circling
With nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
And suddenly I see that I can't break free--I'm
Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony
To tell me who I am, who I was
Uncertainty enveloping my mind
Till I can't break free, and

Maybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
So I'm tired of all the pain, of the misery inside
And I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the
night
You can tell me what to say; you can tell me where to
go
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never
know
If I make another move,there'll be no more turning back
Because everything will change, and it all will fade to
black

Will tomorrow ever come? Will I make it through the
night?
Will there ever be a place for the broken in the light?
Am I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay, or should I go?
I've forgotten how to tell. Did I ever even know?
Can I take another step? I've done everything I can
All the people that I see I will never understand
If I find a way to change, if I step into the light
Then I'll never be the same, and it all will fade to
white

Ever on and on I continue circling
With nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
And suddenly I see that I can't break free--I'm
Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony
To tell me who I am, who I was
Uncertainty enveloping my mind
Till I can't break free, and

Maybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
So I'm tired of all the pain, of the misery inside
And I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the
night
You can tell me what to say; you can tell me where to
go
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never
know
If I make another move there'll be no more turning back
Because everything will change, and it all will fade to
black

If I make another move, if I take another step
Then it all would fall apart. There'd be nothing of me
left
If I'm crying in the wind, if I'm crying in the night
Will there ever be a way? Will my heart return to
white?
Can you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I
am?
I've forgotten how to see; I've forgotten if I can
If I opened up my eyes there'd be no more going back,
Because I'd throw it all away, and it all would fade to
black

Awoken

[Verse 1]
What cause have I to feel glad?
I've built my life on judgment and causing pain.
I don't know those eyes I see in the bloodstained chrome
Now everything that I've had and everything I've known have been thrown away.
And with time I've come to find this isn't my home

[Chorus 1]
I've stroked the fire, seen more pain that you can know
The tears of the broken have washed away my soul
Pushed by desire to change the way my stream will flow
Now I've awoken, and I'm taking back control!

[Chorus 2]
I try my best to block out the screams.
But they're haunting me in my dreams
Please break my shackles,�?�I want it to stop

[Verse 2]
I man these wretched machines
Day in, day out, the grinding wears on my brain,
Undermining my sanity, making me question my reality,
But life is not as it seems
Should I take a chance of freedom and throw it all down the drain?
I've been imprisoned, please burn my transgressions away

[Chorus Part 1]
I've stroked the fire, seen more pain that you can know
The tears of the broken have washed away my soul
Pushed by desire to change the way my stream will flow
Now I've awoken, and I'm taking back control!

[Chorus 2]
I try my best to block out the screams.
But they're haunting me in my dreams
Please break my shackles,�?�I want it to stop

[Chorus 1]
I've stroked the fire, seen more pain that you can know
The tears of the broken have washed away my soul
Pushed by desire to change the way my stream will flow
Now I've awoken, and I'm taking back control!

[Chorus 1.5]
I'm sick of hurting, sick of thinking it's all I do,
I break those around me, those spared are very few,
But the, bright sun is burning, and my sky shines ever blue,
Friendships surround me, I'm becoming a part of you

[Chorus 2]
I try my best to block out the screams.
But they're haunting me in my dreams
Please break my shackles,�?�I want it to stop

Rainbow Factory

Now a rainbow's tale isn't quite as nice
As the story we knew of sugar and spice
But a rainbow's easy once you get to know it
With the help of the magic of a pegasus device

Let's delve deeper into rainbow philosophy
Far beyond that of Cloudsdale's mythology
It's easy to misjudge that floating city
With it's alluring decor and social psychology
But with all great things comes a great responsibility
That of Cloudsdale's being weather stability
How, you ask, are they up to the task
To which the answer is in a simple facility

In the Rainbow Factory, where your fears and horrors come true
In the Rainbow Factory, where not a single soul gets through
In the Rainbow Factory, where your fears and horrors come true

(Instrumental)

In the Rainbow Factory, where your fears and horrors come true
In the Rainbow Factory, where not a single soul gets through
In the Rainbow Factory, where your fears and horrors come true
In the Rainbow Factory, where not a single soul gets through

6 Billion Years And Overnight Story

Once a upon a time and place unknown
Lived a boy forgot and left all alone
No one knew what he could do or of this fairytale

Probably since before the day I was born
Call it fate but I was drowned with scorn
No one tried to be on my side so I'd turn the other cheek

I can't help my feeling sad
Though I guess it ain't too bad
Calling from the setting sun
Took my hand and flew away

Tell me why Tell me why
No one ever tells me why
Why they hate me and despise me when I haven't done a thing
In the rain all I feel is this never ending chill
But a trillion trillion trillion years had left me freezing cold

Can I die? Can I die?
I'm just waiting 'til I die
Never dreamed a single dream so kind in my entire life
No one knew, even cared for this fleeting fairy tail
Then it slipped into seething sun and soon it sailed away

All this time it bore right down to the core
All the pain had torn and left me sore
Right behind you had all this time been watching from my side

Cannot look or hear or speak to me
But you did "Your name, will you tell me it please?"
I can't give and I wish I did
But I just don't have the tongue

Crave a home I've never had
Though I guess it ain't too bad
"Let's just leave and go back home"
Take my hand and fly away

Tell me why Tell me why
No one ever tells me why
Why you think you're just a kid when you can do so many things
On my own never known of this light leading me home
But a trillion trillion trillion years had taught me I'm alone

"Can I try? Can I try?"
"Never know until I try"
But they'll kill you if they see you trying now to save my life
In the rain all we feel is this never ending chill
But we'll slip into the seething sun and soon we'll sail away

Day is done now and soon the dawn will break
Play 'til we drop so that we'll never have to wake
What if this place was made of only me and you?
If just the world and everyone would all go away
If just the world and everyone would all go away

Tell me why Tell me why
A small voice will tell me why
No it's not the voice of you or I but
ALL MAN KIND
Can't resist, we'll be missed That's a lie but I insist
That we'll slip into the seething sun and soon we'll sail away

Tell me why Tell me why
Though you answer to me "why?"
What's your name and where're we going? But hell that's the fun of life!
In the rain I don't care just as long as you are there
'Cause a trillion trillion trillion years had left me thinking clear

Tell me why, tell me dear
There's ringing in my ear

Then we slipped into the seething sun and finally sailed away!

Bloody Mary

Love is just a history that they may 
prove
And when you're gone I'll tell them 
my religion's you
When Pontius comes to kill the king 
upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

I'll dance, dance, dance with my 
hands, hands, hands 
Above my head, head, head like 
Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance with 
my hands, hands 
Hands above my head, hands 
together
Forgive him before he's dead 
because

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see
When you're gone, I'll still be Bloody 
Mary

We are not just art for Michelangelo 
To carve, he can't rewrite the agro 
Of my furied heart, I'll wait on 
mountain tops in Paris 
cold
Je ne veux pas mourir tout seule

I'll dance, dance, dance with my 
hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head like 
Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance with 
my hands, hands 
Hands above my head, hands 
together
Forgive him before he's dead 
because

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see
When you're gone, I'll still be Bloody 
Mary
