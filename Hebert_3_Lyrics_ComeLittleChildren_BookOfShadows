Come Little Children
I'll Take Thee Away,
Into A Land Of
Enchantment

Come Little Children
The Time's Come To Play
Here In My Garden
Of Magic

Follow Sweet Children
I'll Show Thee The Way
Through All The Pain And
The Sorrows

Weep Not Poor Children
For Life Is This Way
Murdering Beauty
And Passion

Hush Now Dear Children
It Must Be This Way
To Weary Of Life And
Deceptions

Rest Now My Children
For Soon We'll Away
into The Calm And
The Quiet

Come Little Children
I'll Take Thee Away,
Into A Land Of
Enchantment

Come Little Children
The Time's Come To Play
Here In My Garden
Of Shadow
