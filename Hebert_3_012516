Briefly describe what you could have done to successfully complete your game?
Found a way to get MY game working (including remembering to actually send the entire file here,
which took quite a while)

Describe your problem solving / trouble shooting process.
I don't understand the problem solving part, but I assume that these are the same thing,
so, I found a  problem, got help, fixed it, had another problem, repeat several times
